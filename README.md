# Draft_GeyserItemsadderResourcepack
This is a draft of a resource pack made a year ago to be compatible with IADefaultPack and other configurations.  
The whole resource pack uses very old stuff and is not aesthetically pleasing. In fact, I still haven't learned how to make Bedrock Edition resource packs.  
This package and mapping cannot be used directly! ! !  
Contents include: items, blocks, chestui
